        "### Description\n",
        "- OpenAI Whisper is an AI model designed to understand and transcribe spoken language.\n",
        "- It is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system designed to convert spoken language into written text.\n",
        "- Few Use cases could be\n",
        "  - 1. Transcription services: Transcribe audio and video content for generating accurate meeting notes, interviews, lectures, and any spoken content that needs to be documented in text form.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - 2. Captioning / Subtitling: Generate subtitles and closed captions for videos this could be for use by differently ability or others.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - 3. Language learning and translation: Whisper's can transcribe in multiple languages - enabled by language learning applications. Useful for pronunciation practice, listening comprehensio and real-time cross-lingual communication.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - 4. Accessibility tools: One use case could be to integrate into other assistive technologies for sat speech impairments - enhancing device or product usability\n",
        "\n",
        "  Multiple other use cases like for Content Search, Voice-controlled applications, Customer support Services, Online Content like Podcasting\n",
        "\n",
        "- If you want to use your own OpenAI Whisper then you need to get your OpenAI API and also need sample Audio files for experimenting."
